1.Coverage area of every asset : The assumption right now, is that every assets can see on one grid. But as the visibility of drones is more, it could send information back about a collection of grids at once. 
2.Deploying assets before the soldier to scan environment and return intel, instead of risking the soldier to get in. 
3.Make system more efficient by programming assets in a way to know the most about the environment instead of moving around randomly and sending intel. Areas covered once need not be covered again. 
4.Intel about the extent of danger.
